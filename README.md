# Practice-projects-in-Python
Collection of my projects to practice coding in Python from the course "Scientific Computing with Python (Beta)" at FreeCodeCamp.org

The collection will include more than ten Python3 projects.

The main goal of this activity is to keep track of all the projects I do on Python and share it with anyone interested.

* Please find the Project files in the 'Branches' section.
